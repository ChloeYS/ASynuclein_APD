# ASynuclein_APD repository

## Description
The code in this repository allowed us to obtain the values published in "Cerebrospinal fluid Î±-synuclein seeding activity in patients with atypical parkinsonian disorders". It is meant mostly for others to be able to review the steps followed in the analysis (eg: testing of assumptions, evaluation of model diagnostics, model selection) as well as the exact R functions used in the code. If necessary, it can be used as a way to share further information about the analysis that was not included in the original manuscript. 

## Content
The repository contains the following files: 
0. README.md 
1. Functions.R: stereotypic calls for basic functions that get repeated throughout the code
2. DFCreation_Function_APD.R: Function that creates the dataframe to be used for analysis. Creates new variables, standardizes the format, etc
3. Test_APD.R: Actual analysis file
